  "abstract": "We present a NeRF-based pipeline that reconstructs canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB drone images. We formalize capture considerations (near-nadir, high overlap/density, fine GSD, and especially diffuse light), adopt a low-light loss, and propose two complementary canopy removal approaches: DTM-based volumetric clipping and segmentation-based filtering. We demonstrate downstream tasks: search-and-rescue person detection and forest inventory (tree stem counting).",
