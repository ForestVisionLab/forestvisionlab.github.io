  "abstract": "We present a NeRF-based pipeline that reconstructs canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB drone images. We formalize capture considerations (near-nadir, high overlap/density, fine GSD, and especially diffuse light), adopt a low-light loss, and propose two complementary canopy removal approaches: DTM-based volumetric clipping and segmentation-based filtering. We demonstrate downstream tasks: search-and-rescue person detection and forest inventory (tree stem counting).",

        "description": "We export the trained NeRF into a dense 3D point cloud (sampling the density field) and apply a three-step post-processing pipeline to obtain a foliage-free cloud dominated by vertical stem fragments: (1) color-based foliage removal using segmentation, (2) a 3D crop to prune remaining high-canopy branches, and (3) a crop from below to remove terrain by retaining only points above the local DTM. On the processed cloud, we run HDBSCAN to cluster stem candidates, filter clusters by volumetric extent, estimate stem tilt using PCA to remove non-vertical candidates, and merge stacked clusters that likely belong to the same tree.",
